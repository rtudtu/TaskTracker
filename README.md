# Tasktracker 3
-Users may register accounts with an email, name, and password
-Users may log in using their email and password. Incorrect combinations
yield no effect
-Once logged in, users may create tasks that are assigned to themselves
--Status is a text input so user can customize status. status of 'Complete' will set a task to 'done' and the task will be visually green on the tasks list
-Users may assign tasks (only tasks that are assigned to them currently) to
other Users
-Time spent is input when users 'Complete' a task or update it with the 'Complete' Button
NOTE: Do not create more than 1 user or task when on the same page - come back to the register page or come back to the 'create task' page to create another
